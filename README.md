Accepts fields from SmartResponse and writes them out to a text file which is consumed by the LogRhythm Job Manager and added to a LogRhythm List (configured in the List Manager).
  
####Usage:
Once imported into LogRhythm, the user specifies data (typically an Alarm field) and a text file to be written. In the List Manager, a list must be configured to auto-import this file.
